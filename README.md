# final project by Xiyin Deng and Haoyue Xing

We use dataset named "Airbnb listing in New York City":

The data set collected information about Airbnb, a short-term rental platform, in New York City.

We disscuss two question:

(1) What are the characteristics of the room distribution?

- We used scatter plots and bar charts to depict the distribution 
characteristics of different housing types in different areas.
- Added two filtersï¼Œhouse type and neighborhood, to display images interactively.
- To summary, for the first question, there are more houses in the first two districts and the number of share rooms is always small, so we speculate that fewer people are willing to rent share room than to rent alone in New York.

(2) How does price relate to neighborhood group?

- We explore the relationship between prices and neighborhood_group through boxplot and segmentation of price data.
- the properties have large differences in prices, prices in Manhattan are generally high, and the most expensive houses are concentrated in this area. 
- According to these data, we can find the corresponding supply gap and the main consumption range of customers.
